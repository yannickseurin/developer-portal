# Provider's LiveApp

As explained in the [Sell Integration](../sell) page, you need to modify your LiveApp with some particularities compared to the one that can be found in the Discover section.

Your LiveApp must: 
  - Use the Ledger's [exchangeSDK](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/exchange-sdk), in addition to the Wallet API.
  - Respond to specific LiveApp URLs in order to adapt to the flow inside Ledger Live.
  - Have a modified, slightly more complex, Manifest file.
  - Follow specifics flow/ux requirements.


## Ledger's exchange SDK

To learn how to create (or embed if already existing) your user interface for the sell, please follow the [Discover documentation](../../discover).

Your LiveApp will interact with Ledger Live, through the [ExchangeSDK](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/exchange-sdk), with the corresponding method.

You will need to set up the SDK with your `providerId` attributed upon request by Ledger.

### SELL method

This method will need you to provide the following parameters:

* `quoteId`: the id coming from your system and [forwarded to your LiveApp](./providers-liveapp) as a query parameter
* `accountId`: user's account id, [previously given to the LiveApp](./providers-liveapp) as a query parameter
* `amount`: amount that will be sold
* `feeStrategy`: `SLOW`, `MEDIUM`, `FAST` or `CUSTOM`.
* `getSellPayload`: callback method called by the sell process to retrieve the payload (see below)

The `getSellPayload` is a callback that during the Sell process will be called with a `nonce`.
This value is required to craft on your side the Sell Payload, which will be returned by the callback.

```js copy
  exchangeSDK.sell({
    quoteId: "1234",
    accountId: "07AB5930-C73A-433F-A2FA-920640AF3A02",
    amount: "0.8",
    feeStrategy: "SLOW",
    getSellPayload: (nonce, sellAddress, amount) => {
      // Crafting Payload...
      return {
        recipientAddress: "0xc0ffee254729296a45a3885639AC7E10F9d54979"
        amount: BigInt("800000000000000000")
        binaryPayload: "YiA1CuoMl_dH8dD3YIFGFKR1I4AbGut9C8u6oqT0a_gYSw==",
        signature: "HA8qBfo8yFNzbV60Ws8GT54UWeing3kcDIdnov2nT9gFB58JybFE1sK0Ext3kARXhZ9J1sbltkBSeuzBdSkjVg==",
      };
    }
  });
```

## LiveApp URL

The LiveApp needs to respond to a URL with some parameters. LiveApp URLs are used to open your LiveApp with the quote values that the user already entered in Ledger Live.

The LiveApp URL format is already fixed and will depend on the information you provided inside your [LiveApp manifest](../../../../docs/discover/wallet-api/appendix/manifest) (ex: `ledgerlive://discover/swapprovidername`).


  * `account-id`: Userâ€™s selected account id, where the crypto he wants to sell is stored.
  * `crypto-currency`: The crypto currency that the user wants to sell. It will contain the providerId value to identify the crypto.
  * `fiat-currency`: The fiat currency that the user wants to be paid with.
  * `crypto-amount`: The crypto amount that the user wants to sell.
  * `payment-method`: The preferred payment method for the user.
  * `mode`: `buy` or `sell`. In this case always sell. Required you share the same base widget url for both usages.
  * `bank-residency`: The bank residency of the user.
  * `ledger-transaction-id`: id used by ledger to track transactions and their completion statuses.

__Example__:
```
https://sell.provider.widget.com?[account-id]=ua11-â€¦&[crypto-currency]=BTC&[fiat-currency]=EUR&[crypto-amount]=0.04
```

  Ledger needs to know how to send referral information through the widget.

## Manifest Permission
Your [LiveApp manifest](../../../../docs/discover/wallet-api/appendix/manifest) should contains at least those permissions request:
```json copy
"permissions": [
  "account.list",
  "currency.list",
  "custom.exchange.start", 
  "custom.exchange.complete",
]
```
