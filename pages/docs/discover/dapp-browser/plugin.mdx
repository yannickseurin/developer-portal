# Write a plugin for clear signing

The plugin will enable clear signing on smart contracts and ensure more security for our users.

To develop a plugin, follow the documentation in [the Plugin section](/docs/device-app/introduction/plugins/) of the Developer Portal.

# Reference the plugin in the manifest

When the plugin is available you can add it to the manifest in the field [`dapp.nanoApp`](./manifest#here-is-the-list-of-the-mandatory-fields-required-in-your-manifest-file)
