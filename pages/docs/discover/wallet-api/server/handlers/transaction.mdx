## overview

The Transaction handlers allows the server to interact with user transactions.
It enables the server to let the user sign a transaction and also allows the server to sign and broadcast a transaction through Ledger Live.

## request handlers:

### "transaction.sign" - Sign Transaction

Let the user sign a transaction without broadcasting it. This is useful if you want to sign a transaction for later use.
