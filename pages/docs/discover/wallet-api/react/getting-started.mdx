# Getting Started with Ledger's Wallet API

Welcome to the getting started guide for Ledger's Wallet API. We are excited to have you onboard and look forward to
seeing what you'll create.

Ledger's Wallet API can be integrated with both client and server-side applications, offering you flexibility and
enabling diverse use-cases.

## Installation

Let's begin by installing the base package.

You can use your favorite package manager, npm, yarn or pnpm, to install the `@ledgerhq/wallet-api-client` package.

```sh npm2yarn
npm install @ledgerhq/wallet-api-client
```

### Using Ledger's Wallet API with React

We offer a specific package to facilitate easy integration of the Wallet API:
`@ledgerhq/wallet-api-client-react`.

```sh npm2yarn
npm install @ledgerhq/wallet-api-client-react
```

This package provides handy React hooks to interact with Ledger's Wallet API.

### Testing with Simulator

To test the Wallet API without connecting to the Ledger Live App directly, you can use the
`@ledgerhq/wallet-api-simulator` package.

```sh npm2yarn
npm install @ledgerhq/wallet-api-simulator
```

Remember, this package currently only functions with server-side applications due to a dependency requiring the usage
of `process`.

Now that you've successfully installed the necessary packages, you're ready to start crafting with Ledger's Wallet
API. In the next page, we'll guide you through the process of setting up and configuring the Wallet API in your
application.
