### 9. **Creating a Manifest File**

A manifest file is necessary to test your Live App inside Ledger Live. Create a `manifest.json` file at the root of your project. Here is a sample manifest you can use:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://live-app-catalog.ledger.com/schema.json",
  "id": "SampleLiveApp",
  "name": "SampleLiveApp",
  "url": "http://localhost:3000/",
  "homepageUrl": "http://localhost:3000/",
  "platform": ["ios", "android", "desktop"],
  "apiVersion": "^2.0.0",
  "manifestVersion": "2",
  "branch": "stable",
  "categories": ["NFT", "Swap", "YourAppCategory"],
  "currencies": "*",
  "content": {
    "shortDescription": {
      "en": "Desc"
    },
    "description": {
      "en": "Desc"
    }
  },
  "permissions": [
    "account.list",
    "account.receive",
    "account.request",
    "currency.list",
    "message.sign",
    "transaction.sign",
    "transaction.signAndBroadcast",
    "wallet.capabilities",
    "wallet.info",
    "wallet.userId"
  ],
  "domains": ["http://", "https://"],
  "visibility": "complete"
}
```

### 10. **Importing Manifest in Ledger Live**

Ensure Ledger Live Desktop is installed on your computer. Enable Developer mode in Ledger Live by navigating to **Settings** -> **About**, and clicking ten times on the Ledger Live version. This will reveal a new **Developer** section in the settings menu.

- Enable **platform dev tools**.
- Click on **Browse** next to **Add a local app** and select the manifest you created.

Now you'll see a new row in the menu with the name of your Live App. You can now open and test your Live App within Ledger Live.
