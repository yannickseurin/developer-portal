# Testing

Testing a plugin is very similar to that of a standalone app, with the [Ragger framework](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ragger/) and [Speculos](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/speculos/). There are however a few differences :

## Ethereum Ragger client

It is a [Python module](https://pypi.org/project/ledger-app-clients.ethereum/) that abstracts the APDU crafting and response parsing. It comes from the Ethereum app itself and is what's used to test it in its CI but also has everything needed for testing plugins.
It also comes with test signing keys so that APDUs that are signed by either the CAL or a backend in production can be signed during the test and verified by the Ethereum app.

## ABIs

The Ethereum Ragger client relies on [Web3.py](https://pypi.org/project/web3/) for transaction crafting, it can also leverage a smart contract's ABI (Application Binary Interface) which is obtainable from a website like [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/). It makes it really easy to craft a function call which greatly helps tests readability.
You could also use the raw payload of a real transaction from the blockchain but it is unreadable and doesn't add any value to the test, so we don't recommend it.

## Signature verification

The Ragger client can also easily verify a transaction's signature by [recovering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm#Public_key_recovery) the Ethereum address of the wallet that signed the transaction.
Testing the UI is crucial but so is testing the signatures we produce.

## Development environment

While doing it with any text editor/IDE is possible, the easiest way and what we recommend is through Visual Studio Code with the official [Ledger Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LedgerHQ.ledger-dev-tools) that has full support for plugin development and testing.
