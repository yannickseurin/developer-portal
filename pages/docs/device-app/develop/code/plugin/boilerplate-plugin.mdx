import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

# Setup

This step is getting the plugin to compile. But first, we need to set up the working environment linked to the Ethereum app.

## Clone the Ethereum App

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-ethereum
cd app-ethereum
```

## Build the Ethereum App

You can easily build the Ethereum app by following these [instructions](../../quickstart).

Once you've successfully compiled the Ethereum app you are ready to walk through the Boilerplate plugin example.

# Boilerplate plugin

Here is a boilerplate plugin to help you write your own. This guide walks you through the plugin.

You can follow it best by forking the repository [app-plugin-boilerplate](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-plugin-boilerplate).

```sh
cd ..
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-plugin-boilerplate
```

## What's what

There is no need to build it right now, only after adding tests. For now, in `app-plugin-boilerplate/` there are these folders:
- `ethereum-plugin-sdk`: This repository contains information shared by the Ethereum app and your plugin, such as structure definitions, utility functions, etc.
- `icons` and `glyphs` : plugin icons as displayed on the device. We will get to it later, but you can read about it [here](../../../deliver/deliverables/icons/#device-icon).
- `src`: the actual source code (in C).
- `tests`: the test folder (using the Ragger testing framework).
- `.github/workflows` : the CI workflows which are a requirement to submit your plugin. To have more details you can refer to this [documentation](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-workflows/).


## Change the plugin info

There is the `Makefile` directly in the repository root. You need to open `Makefile` and change the plugin infos including `APPNAME` to suit your plugin name (e.g., Paraswap, 1inch, Lido), `APPVERSION` for plugin version and other various infos.
